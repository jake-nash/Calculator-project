# Calculator

So it's really ugly, obviously I didn't put any time into making the buttons look pretty other than making them into a nice and neat grid.

However, I'm proud of the functionality. Everything works normally, and it remembers the last result; for example, if you type '13\*5=' (and it spits out 65), then type '/\-6.5' it will spit out \-10. Also, it remembers the last operation, so if you type '8\*3=' (and it spits out 24), then just press '=', it will do 24\*3 and spit out 72, if you press equals again it does \*3 again, and so on.
Also of course everything stays how it was if you rotate the phone, even in the middle of typing arguments for an expression.
